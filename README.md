## 👋 About

I am a graduate Data Science student focused on building **scalable, production-ready machine learning systems**.

My work spans:
- Predictive modeling at scale  
- Real-time computer vision systems  
- IoT-integrated data pipelines  
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architectures  

I enjoy solving problems where data, systems design, and engineering intersect.

Previously served as **Technical Lead at IoTesSENSE**, leading 80+ members and organizing 12 hackathons.
